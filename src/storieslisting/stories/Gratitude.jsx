            Gratitude is one of the most powerful emotions we can experience. It has been scientifically proven to improve our mental and physical health, enhance our relationships, and increase our overall happiness. But what exactly is gratitude, and how can we cultivate this powerful emotion in our daily lives?
            Gratitude is the act of acknowledging and appreciating the good things in our lives, no matter how small they may seem. It's about focusing on what we have, rather than what we lack. And while gratitude may seem like a simple concept, it can have profound effects on our well-being.
            Research has shown that people who practice gratitude on a regular basis experience a range of benefits. These benefits include:

           <h3>Improved mental health</h3>
           Gratitude has been linked to lower levels of depression and anxiety, and increased feelings of happiness and life satisfaction.Remember how many times you have appreciated someone for doing something for you.Even if you did not buy it yourself the fact that you showed gratitude made you feel free and made you feel entitled to the present that you were  given.Although the society has made showing gratitude as a norm that people should be doing,sometimes gratitude vary in magnitude.You can feel when someone is sincerely grateful to you and when he/she is pretending to show gratitude.Gratitude should come from your inner heart dont force force someone to show gratitude to you but you should force yourself to show gratitude from the bottom of your heart
  
           <h3>Better physical health</h3>
           Grateful people are more likely to engage in healthy behaviors like exercising and getting enough sleep, which can lead to better physical health outcomes.Like for me who wants to live for more than 100 years ,I have made gratitude my brother.I mean,what does it cost to show gratitude to others? Nothing and if it has a lot of benefits attached to it I am good for it. If you are grateful to a hotel owner the next time you visit you will eat for free -(donot try at the hotel though).So just practising showing gratitude even if its once in a while it counts a lot.
