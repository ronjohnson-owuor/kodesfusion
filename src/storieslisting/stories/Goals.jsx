            Do you ever feel like you're chasing after a goal that keeps slipping away? Don't worry, you're not alone! The problem isn't your ability to achieve your goals, it's the way you're setting them. That's where SMART goals come in. They're Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. And trust me, this isn't just another acronym to remember - it's a game changer!

            Let's start with the S in SMART goals. Your goal needs to be specific. Not just "lose weight," but "lose 10 pounds of pure fat." No ifs, ands, or buts. If you're not specific, you'll end up chasing your tail like a dog chasing its own tail.You must make your goals more specific and strait to the point so that your brain could know what exactly you want to achieve and its going to help you do so.Let us say that you have a target of learning a new language.When you put a target about learning a new language your brain is not going to automatically want to help you achieve your goal.Why ,because it does not know what language you want to learn.But if you want to learn french by the end of two months, your brain is going to have a clear mind map of what you want to do but not that instead you can say am goind tolearn french by using this type of book and this website this is great all you have left is just to hop on those websites and buy those books and start working  to improve your french vocabulary.So,it is important to set  smart goal

                Now onto the M. Your goal needs to be measurable. "Save money" is not measurable, but "save $500 by the end of the month" is. If you don't have a way to measure your progress, you won't know if you're making any progress at all. It's like driving with a blindfold on - not recommended.You must have a measurable goal in order to know where you are coming from and what exactly are you left with to cover so that you can enjoy the fruits of your labour.You also cant say that you want to buy 20 teslas in less than to months,unless you are Elon Musk.I doubt ether you will be able to achieve thos goals and that takes us to the next topic

                 Next up, A for achievable. Don't set yourself up for failure! I mean, unless you enjoy the feeling of disappointment. Be realistic. If you're afraid of heights, don't set a goal to climb Mount Everest. That's like asking a vegetarian to eat a steak. Just, no.The way I said, dont set your self to failure.Dissappointment is the last thing we can think of in our life because who wants it? it is a energy draining experience except if you are inventing something like the lightbulb but apart from that you are going to need to achieve your goals in order to stay motivated to achieve them.Dont set yourself up for failure and then start crying how luck is not on your side.Set achievable goals you can set a long term goal but in the porcess set small achievable goals that act as a fuel to push you up the ladder.The best feeling in the world is the feeling that we get when we have all thing in control and we can feel that we are in the controls  seat.
      <h3></h3>
                 Moving on to R for relevant. Your goal needs to be relevant to your life. Don't set a goal to run a marathon if you hate running. Set a goal that aligns with your values and priorities. If you're a couch potato, set a goal to finish watching all the episodes of your favorite TV show. It may not be a Nobel Prize-winning accomplishment, but hey, it's relevant to your life!.You may be asking what is a relevant goal.It is simple to define a relevant goal,Just ask yourself is the goal you are setting relevant to your values and principle.If your answer is no then scrap the distraction and work on your goals.If I dont enjoy working for people  I cant set a goal to work for 100 hours just to achieve my financial satability.Dont let your morals and prnciple cross with your goals because if they cross you will not have peace that you think you are looking for.

                 Last but not least, T for time-bound. You need a deadline. Otherwise, your goal will keep moving further and further away like a mirage in the desert. Set a realistic timeframe for achieving your goal. And yes, procrastination is not an option. That deadline is there for a reason.Just like you cannot have 20 teslas in one month is the way your goals cannot be achieved in the set timeframe.Dont set too long timeframe because you will loose motivation to work on  your ideas and goals  and also dont set too short because you will be dissapointed if they are not achieved. 

               <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              Setting SMART goals may seem like a daunting task, but trust me, it's worth it. By being specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound, you'll give yourself a roadmap to success. And who doesn't love a good roadmap? So go ahead, set your SMART goals, and achieve anything you want without losing your sanity.But sometimes losing sanity is also good if you are an aspiring billionaire who wears one type of outfit the whole of his life and resting in a mega yatch somewhere.
